Go to AWS
Go to S3
Create a bucket
name: whatever
whatever region, but take note of it
block public access
disable versioning
enable encryption

go to IAM
go to users
find your user
go to security credentials
create access key
doesnt matter what use, pick one and check the box that you understand access key BAD IDEA
name the key with your name and purpose (in case you need to delete it later)
download the csv, save the id and secret, however you please, you cant get it again (have to make a new one)

you will use the id and secret in your env file to access the bucket in boto3 (python)
