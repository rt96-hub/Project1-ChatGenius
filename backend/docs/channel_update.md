# New Channel Joining Features

## Overview
Implementation of a new channel discovery and joining system that allows users to browse and join public channels through a dedicated interface.

## Backend Additions

### New API Endpoints
- [ ] Add `/channels/available` endpoint to list joinable public channels
  - Should support pagination
  - Filter out channels user is already a member of
  - Include member count and last activity
  - Support search/filtering
- [ ] Add `/channels/{channel_id}/join` endpoint for joining channels
  - Handle permissions and validation
  - Return updated channel data
- [ ] Add `/channels/{channel_id}/members/count` endpoint for member statistics

### New CRUD Operations
- [ ] Create `get_available_channels()` function in `crud.py`
  - Filter channels by privacy setting
  - Exclude user's current channels
  - Include sorting options (alphabetical, member count, activity)
- [ ] Create `join_channel()` function in `crud.py`
  - Handle user addition to channel
  - Validate joining permissions
  - Update channel statistics
- [ ] Add functions for channel statistics and activity tracking

### Database Updates
- [ ] Add last_activity timestamp to Channel model
- [ ] Add member_count cache field to Channel model
- [ ] Create migration for new fields
- [ ] Add indices for efficient channel querying

### WebSocket Events
- [ ] Add channel_joined event type
- [ ] Add member_count_updated event type
- [ ] Update channel_updated event to include new fields

## Frontend Additions

### New Components
- [ ] Create `ChannelListPopout` modal component
  - Search/filter input
  - Channel list with pagination
  - Channel cards with join buttons
  - Loading states
  - Error handling
- [ ] Create `ChannelCard` component
  - Display channel name, description
  - Show member count
  - Last activity indicator
  - Join button with loading state
- [ ] Add "Browse Channels" button to Sidebar

### New Types
- [ ] Create `AvailableChannel` interface
  - Include member count
  - Include last activity
  - Include preview information
- [ ] Create channel joining related types
- [ ] Add WebSocket event types for new events

### New Hooks
- [ ] Create `useAvailableChannels` hook
  - Fetch available channels
  - Handle pagination
  - Handle search/filtering
- [ ] Create `useJoinChannel` hook
  - Handle channel joining
  - Manage loading states
  - Handle errors
- [ ] Create `useChannelStatistics` hook

### State Management
- [ ] Add available channels to ChannelContext
- [ ] Add channel joining state management
- [ ] Handle WebSocket updates for member counts
- [ ] Manage search/filter state

### UI/UX Considerations
- [ ] Design channel browsing interface
  - Clear channel information display
  - Intuitive joining process
  - Responsive layout
- [ ] Add loading indicators
  - During channel list fetch
  - During join operation
- [ ] Add error states
  - Failed to load channels
  - Failed to join channel
- [ ] Add success feedback
  - Channel joined successfully
  - Automatic navigation to joined channel

### Security Considerations
- [ ] Implement rate limiting for channel joining
- [ ] Add validation for channel joining permissions
- [ ] Ensure private channels remain hidden
- [ ] Add audit logging for channel joins

### Testing Requirements
- [ ] Test available channels endpoint
- [ ] Test channel joining flow
- [ ] Test WebSocket events
- [ ] Test UI components
- [ ] Test error scenarios
- [ ] Test pagination and filtering

### Documentation Needs
- [ ] Document new API endpoints
- [ ] Update WebSocket event documentation
- [ ] Document new components
- [ ] Add UI/UX guidelines
- [ ] Update development setup instructions

### Performance Considerations
- [ ] Optimize channel list queries
- [ ] Implement efficient pagination
- [ ] Cache channel statistics
- [ ] Optimize WebSocket updates
- [ ] Consider lazy loading for channel list

### Migration Considerations
- [ ] Handle transition for existing channels
- [ ] Update channel statistics for existing channels
- [ ] Ensure backward compatibility
- [ ] Plan phased rollout
