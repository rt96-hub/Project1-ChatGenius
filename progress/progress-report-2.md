### Progress Report 2: Slack-like Communication Platform

#### Implemented Features:

1. **Authentication System:**
   - Auth0 integration for secure authentication
   - User synchronization between Auth0 and local database
   - Token validation and verification endpoints
   - Protected routes with authentication middleware
   - User session management

2. **User Management:**
   - Basic user profiles with Auth0 data
   - User CRUD operations
   - User listing and search capabilities
   - Profile picture support

3. **Channel System:**
   - Basic channel creation and management
   - Channel listing and joining functionality
   - Real-time channel updates via WebSocket
   - Channel membership tracking

4. **Real-time Communication:**
   - WebSocket implementation for real-time messaging
   - Message persistence in PostgreSQL
   - Basic message broadcasting to channel members
   - Connection management system

#### Features to Implement (Ordered by Priority and Complexity):

1. **High Priority, Low Complexity:**
   - Message timestamps and metadata (sent/edited time)
   - Basic message operations (edit, delete)
   - Loading indicator for message pagination
   - Dynamic text input field improvements
   - Channel leave functionality
   - Confirmation dialogs for destructive actions

2. **High Priority, Medium Complexity:**
   - Channel permissions and roles
   - User profile enhancements (bio, mutual channels)
   - System messages for channel events
   - Message notifications for unread messages
   - Basic user discovery and search

3. **Medium Priority, Medium Complexity:**
   - Email verification system
   - User presence indicators
   - Direct messaging functionality
   - File upload and sharing
   - Message threading

4. **Lower Priority, High Complexity:**
   - AI channel conversation summarization
   - Advanced search capabilities
   - Rich text message formatting
   - Message reactions and emoji support
   - Integration with external services

#### Next Steps:
1. Implement basic message operations (edit, delete, timestamps)
2. Add channel permissions and roles
3. Enhance user profiles and discovery
4. Implement system messages for better user experience
5. Add real-time notifications for messages
6. When a user is disconnected from the server, messages that are sent are queued up and sent when the user reconnects
7. Add a "leave channel" button to the channel page

#### Technical Debt and Improvements:
1. Add comprehensive test coverage for authentication
2. Implement proper error handling and logging
3. Optimize database queries and indexes
4. Add rate limiting for API endpoints
5. Implement caching for frequently accessed data
