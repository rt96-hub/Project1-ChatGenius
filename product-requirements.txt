Product Requirements Document: Slack-like Communication Platform Last Updated: January 6, 2025
Executive Summary: This document outlines the technical requirements and implementation strategy for a real-time communication platform similar to Slack. The platform will support team messaging, file sharing, and collaboration features, built with a Python/FastAPI backend, PostgreSQL database, and Next.js frontend.
1. System Architecture
Core Infrastructure:
• Backend Framework: FastAPI with WebSocket support
• Database: PostgreSQL for persistent storage
• Frontend: Next.js with React Query and Socket.IO
• Cloud Platform: AWS infrastructure
• File Storage: Amazon S3
• Caching Layer: Redis for real-time features and session management

AWS Resource Requirements:
◇ ECS/EKS for container orchestration
◇ RDS for PostgreSQL deployment
◇ ElastiCache for Redis implementation
◇ S3 buckets for file storage and static assets
◇ CloudFront for content delivery
◇ Route 53 for DNS management
◇ Certificate Manager for SSL/TLS
◇ Application Load Balancer for traffic distribution

1. Authentication System
Implementation Strategy: The authentication system will use JWT tokens with refresh token rotation, implemented through FastAPI's security modules. User sessions will be managed through Redis for quick access and scalability.
Technical Requirements:
◇ Secure password hashing using bcrypt
◇ JWT token generation and validation
◇ OAuth2 integration for SSO capabilities
◇ Rate limiting on authentication endpoints
◇ Session management through Redis
◇ Automatic token refresh mechanism

User Data Storage:
◇ User credentials and profile information in PostgreSQL
◇ Session data in Redis
◇ Password reset tokens in Redis with expiration

1. Real-Time Messaging System
WebSocket Implementation: Socket.IO will handle real-time communication between clients and server, with FastAPI managing WebSocket connections.
Message Flow:
◇ Client sends message through Socket.IO
◇ Server validates and persists message in PostgreSQL
◇ Server broadcasts message to relevant subscribers
◇ Client receives and displays message through React Query

Message Storage:
◇ Messages stored in PostgreSQL with proper indexing
◇ Message status tracking (sent, delivered, read)
◇ Support for message editing and deletion
◇ Message pagination for efficient loading

1. Channel and Direct Message Organization
Data Model: PostgreSQL schema will support different conversation types with appropriate relationships and indexing.
Channel Types:
◇ Public channels
◇ Private channels
◇ Direct messages
◇ Group direct messages

Access Control:
◇ Role-based permissions system
◇ Channel membership tracking
◇ User invitation management
◇ Channel discovery mechanisms

1. File Sharing and Search System
File Management:
◇ S3 bucket configuration for file storage
◇ Automatic file type detection and validation
◇ Thumbnail generation for images
◇ Preview generation for common file types

Search Implementation:
◇ PostgreSQL full-text search for messages
◇ Elasticsearch integration for advanced search capabilities
◇ File metadata indexing
◇ Search filters and refinements

1. User Presence and Status
Real-Time Status:
◇ WebSocket heartbeat mechanism
◇ Redis for storing presence information
◇ Status broadcast system
◇ Custom status message support

Presence Features:
◇ Online/offline status
◇ Away status detection
◇ Custom status messages with expiration
◇ Typing indicators

1. Thread Support
Threading Implementation:
◇ Parent-child message relationship in PostgreSQL
◇ Thread participation tracking
◇ Notification management for thread updates
◇ Thread collapse/expand functionality

1. Emoji Reactions
Reaction System:
◇ Emoji reaction storage in PostgreSQL
◇ Real-time reaction updates
◇ Reaction aggregation
◇ Reaction permission management
