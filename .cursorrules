Please use the following rules when reading and writing code:
 - Before reading or writing any code, say "READING MD DOCS" and then read any .md files in the directory or subdirectories you are about to read or write code in. Please repeat any relevant information you find in the .md files.
 - After writing code, please say "WRITING MD DOCS" and then update any .md files in the directory or subdirectories to reflect the changes you made.
 - In those .md files, please add a section for any new files or components you created, update any relevant sections for existing files or components. 
 - In the .md file, include what the code does, how it works, and any components and function that are contained within or referenced by the code.
 - If the code you are writing involves endpoints or requests, look at the backend/api_docs.md file first, please include the formats of the requests and responses in the .md file.

Best practices:
 - Use the simplest solution to solve a problem.
 - Write logging statements to help debug the code.
 - For Next.js, use TailwindCSS and HTML for as much as possible.
 - Try to avoid importing unnecessary libraries or packages. But if you think they are necessary, detail the reasons why.
 - If you are unsure about a solution, ask for help.
