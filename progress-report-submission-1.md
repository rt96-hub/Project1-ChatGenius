   - Database models and schemas are well-structured

2. **Current Focus Areas**
   - Completing channel organization and group direct messaging features
   - Developing reply threads

3. **Technical Recommendations**
   - Prioritize implementing direct messaging and private channels
   - Add file sharing capabilities
   - Implement user presence tracking
   - Complete thread support implementation
   - Finish emoji reaction system

4. **Next Steps**
   - Complete private channel implementation
   - Implement direct messaging system
   - Add file sharing capabilities
   - Develop user presence tracking
   - Finish thread support UI components 

## Learnings

### 1. Proper Documentation
- Documentation should be written and maintained alongside code development
- Each component should have its own dedicated documentation file
- API endpoints should be documented with request/response examples
- Code comments should explain complex logic and business rules
- Documentation should be treated as a first-class citizen in the development process

### 2. Managing Agent Context Window
- Agent context needs to be carefully managed to maintain coherent conversations
- Important to provide relevant context at the start of each conversation
- Breaking down complex tasks into smaller, manageable chunks
- Maintaining state across multiple interactions
- Being explicit about the current state and goals

### 3. Architecture and Deployment
- Early decisions on architecture have long-lasting implications
- Infrastructure as code should be implemented from the start
- Deployment pipelines need to be established early
- Monitoring and logging should be built into the architecture
- Scalability considerations should be part of initial design

### 4. Planning Longer at the Start
- Invest more time in initial planning and architecture design
- Define clear milestones and deliverables
- Establish coding standards and practices early
- Create detailed technical specifications
- Plan for future scalability and maintenance 

### 5. Slow down to speed up
- Take time to understand the problem and the solution
- Don't rush to implement features
- Take time to plan and design the solution
- Consider the needs of the user and product
