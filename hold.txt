Comparison of Frontend API with Backend Documentation
READING MD DOCS
After reviewing the frontend/frontend_api.md and the backend documentation files in backend/app/routers/docs/, I've identified discrepancies between the API endpoints used in the frontend and those documented in the backend. Below is a list of endpoints that are present in the frontend documentation but either missing or have different paths in the backend documentation, along with the frontend components that use them.

Summary
Several endpoints used in the frontend are either not documented in the backend's .md files or have different paths.
The main discrepancies involve endpoints under the /channels path in the frontend that are under /messages in the backend.
It's crucial to:
Update frontend components to use the correct backend endpoints.
Update backend documentation to include all available endpoints.
Ensuring consistency between the frontend and backend will prevent API call failures and enhance maintainability.


Next Steps
Frontend Updates:
Review the ChatArea, ChannelList, DMList, UserProfile, and Search components.
Update the API endpoint paths to match the backend's actual endpoints.
Backend Documentation Updates:
Update the .md files in backend/app/routers/docs/ to include all endpoints.
Ensure request and response formats are correctly documented.
Testing:
After updates, test all API calls from the frontend to confirm they're working as expected.
Verify that data is properly sent and received between the frontend and backend.

double check /channels/${channelId}/messages and see that they need to be /messages/${channelId}/messages
same for reactions, i think they start with channel still
